Then taken over by forum user @micha030201, who did a number of changes.  Thread is here:  https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/114659-modular-computer-package-continued/

@CSVoltagehasn't been around since 2020, @micha030201 hasn't been around since 2013.

 

I've updated all the parts for KSP 1.12

What it does

1.25m probe core
The ultimate in mod integration for small vessels. Allows for "chips" to be attached that can have any number of gadget modules from other mods. Unfortunately the required factory form for all these modules makes it less than aero dynamic. With this in mind the outer radius is actually 1.23451m, not 1.25, and parts clipping & surface attachment are allowed. This way you can stash it inside a structural part. Stock structural will work fine but for access to your chips I recommend using either Service Compartments or Procedural Fairings
Chip
Each chip can hold the code for a different mod's particular gadget. Only chips for mods you have installed will be loaded. Their weight is negligable so the COM of your vessel wont be thrown off.
Core Features

Integrated Radiator
If you are running KSP Interstellar, the radiator has the same stats as the small radial radiator.
Chip Slots
13 slots using the size 0 attachment node
Integrated RTGs
If you are running KSP Interstellar, RTGs will also slowly generate waste heat. The integrated radiator will disperse most, but not all of this.
Hard Drives
This -UNMANNED- probe has hard drives for experiment storage. Using Ship Manifest, you can transfer science to this part from your experiments.
Chip Features

B9: Info Drive
Squad (stock): accelerometer, barometer, gravitometer
Firespitter: move craft gadget, trim gadget
Kerbal Engineer (KER): build engineer, flight engineer
Kerbal Operating System (kOS)
MechJeb
Remote Tech 2: SPU, antenna-integrator
KSP Interstellar: super computer
TT-NeverUnload - (Seriously though, with the advent of 0.24, this is critical for vessel recovery)
ScanSat: MapTraq
I.D. Skillfull Weapons & Damage: FOF Tag
Kerbal Attachment System (KAS)

Each chip can be picked up and placed while on EVA with the use of the KAS plugin. Unfortunately nodes are not useable while on EVA so the collision mesh for the core extends all the way into each slot. Just stick'em in as close as you can.
Texture Switcher

Each Chip now has two texture switchers. The first changes the color of the circuit board, the second changes the label stenciled on the covering.
You can now get boards in red, blue, green, and grey as well as labels for control, info, and sensors.
Basic Chip

I've included a chip that does nothing at all except allow pickup and suck power. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own chips if theres something I've left out. Then, if you could upload or let me know in the comments, after reviewing it I'll include it in the next release.
